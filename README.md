# omdb

A Go package for interacting with the REST API of [The Open Movie Database](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

This API client is autogenerated from the OpenAPI specification, which can be found [here](https://www.omdbapi.com/swagger.json).

## Technical notes

The OpenAPI specification is converted from the original OAS 2.0 format to 3.0.1 using [`converter.swagger.io`](https://converter.swagger.io/)
before it's used for generation.

## Updating

The API client can be re-generated with the `go generate` command.

A `curl` installation is needed.
